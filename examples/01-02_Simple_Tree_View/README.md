# EHM DAL: Example 01.02 - Simple Tree View
The purpose of this example is to show how easily data from either a database or a saved game's database can be shown using QTreeView and exported to csv/xslx spreadsheets. This project is identical to `Example 01-01` except that we're using a QTreeView here for tree tables rather than QTableView for standard two dimensional tables.
